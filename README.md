#  Through the Astronaut’s Eyes  
**A Stellar Story of Space Weather — through the eyes of Earthlings**  
Submission for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**  
Challenge: *Stellar Stories — Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings*

##  Challenge Brief & Problem Statement

**Challenge theme:** *“Stellar Stories: Space Weather through the Eyes of Earthlings”*  
Participants are invited to explore how space weather phenomena — solar flares, coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic storms — affect Earth and its inhabitants, physically or emotionally, and to translate that into compelling narratives or tools for awareness.

**Problem statement:**  
Space weather events are invisible to most people, yet they have real effects — from disrupting communications and power grids to creating auroras and altering satellite operations. The general public often perceives space as distant and abstract.  
**How might we translate these invisible but powerful phenomena into an emotional, experiential narrative — making people *feel* and *understand* space weather through a human lens?**

Our project **“Through the Astronaut’s Eyes”** addresses this by **immersive storytelling**:  
- We humanize space weather phenomena as emotional, visual journeys  
- We bridge science and art, making the invisible visible  
- We educate and evoke wonder about Earth’s connection to space

##  Proposed Solution

We built a **web-based interactive narrative** that simulates, through layered visuals and motion, how an astronaut would perceive the interplay of Earth and solar activity — but seen *from Earth’s viewpoint*, as felt by humanity.  

Key design elements:

- **Dynamic Scenes Representing Space Weather:** Gradients, overlays, and animated layers symbolize solar flares, magnetic fields, and auroras.  
- **Scroll-based Journey:** As users scroll, they traverse through phases: calm solar wind, increasing flare activity, geomagnetic storm, and recovery.  
- **Emotional Narrative of Earthling Perspective:** Text, transitions, and visuals evoke how humanity responds — wonder, tension, disruption, reflection.  
- **Responsive & Accessible:** Works on desktop and mobile to reach broader audiences.  
- **Optional Audio Ambiance:** Background audio (solar hum, electromagnetic pulses) that can be toggled on/off.

##  Features & Innovation

-  **Symbolic Visualizations:** Each section corresponds to a space-weather event (e.g. solar flare, CME, magnetic storm) represented not as raw data but as an emotional visual metaphor.  
-  **Smooth Scroll Transitions:** Users move seamlessly through each stage, with layered parallax and motion reinforcing the narrative.  
-  **Cognitive Connection:** Instead of technical graphs, users *feel* fluctuations, intensities, and recovery rhythms.  
-  **Earth’s Perspective:** The narrative frames space weather as an Earthling’s experience — how we might “see” or sense these phenomena if we had enhanced perception.
